      <h3>Farasat Khan</h3>
      <p> Hi, my name is Farasat and I study Computer Science at City, University Of London. 
Not much to share about myself except thats my birthdays on Christmas day. 
Computer and ICT in general has been my interest since I was young always playing them PC games helped me uderstand alot about the internet and PC's itself. 
I havent had much experiancing with programming, yet I still manage to understand most of it and am able to create fairly simple designs and sketches. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Project 100 Balls</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City (2020). 
This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. 
I created a very simple animation of white balls moving around and bouncing off the edges off the screen back into the box over to the other side. 
All balls are traveling are different speeds, some fast, some slow and some really slow. 
Using various functions such as CLASS, IF AND RANDOM, I was able to allow balls to move in different ways and even add more balls, as many as you want, to the screen. 
The placement of balls will always be different when starting to give it a unique feel. 
It is also very smooth which just gives extra satisfaction to the person watching it.
